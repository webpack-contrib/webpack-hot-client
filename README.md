# webpack-hot-client

A client for enabling, and interacting with, webpack [Hot Module Replacement][hmr-docs].

This is intended to work in concert with [`webpack-dev-middleware`][dev-middleware]
and allows for adding Hot Module Replacement to an existing server, without a
dependency upon [`webpack-dev-server`][dev-server]. This comes in handy for testing
in projects that already use server frameworks such as `Express` or `Koa`.

`webpack-hot-client` accomplishes this by creating a `WebSocket` server, providing
the necessary client (browser) scripts that communicate via `WebSocket`s, and
automagically adding the necessary webpack plugins and config entries. All of
that allows for a seamless integration of Hot Module Support.

Curious about the differences between this module and `webpack-hot-middleware`?
[Read more here](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-hot-client/issues/18).

## Getting Started

To begin, you'll need to install `webpack-hot-client`:

```console
$ npm install webpack-hot-client --save-dev
```

## Gotchas

In order to use `webpack-hot-client`, your `webpack` config should include an
`entry` option that is set to an `Array` of `String`, or an `Object` who's keys
are set to an `Array` of `String`. You may also use a `Function`, but that
function should return a value in one of the two valid formats.

This is primarily due to restrictions in
`webpack` itself and the way that it processes options and entries. For users of
webpack v4+ that go the zero-config route, you must specify an `entry` option.

It's also worth noting that `webpack-hot-client` adds `HotModuleReplacementPlugin`
and the necessary entries to your `webpack` config for you at runtime. Including
the plugin in your config manually while using this module may produce unexpected
or wonky results.

### Express

For setting up the module for use with an `Express` server, try the following:

```js
const client = require('webpack-hot-client');
const middleware = require('webpack-dev-middleware');
const webpack = require('webpack');
const config = require('./webpack.config');

const compiler = webpack(config);
const { publicPath } = config.output;
const options = { ... }; // webpack-hot-client options

// we recommend calling the client _before_ adding the dev middleware
client(compiler, options);

app.use(middleware(compiler, { publicPath }));
```

### Koa

Since `Koa`@2.0.0 was released, the patterns and requirements for using
`webpack-dev-middleware` have changed somewhat, due to use of `async/await` in
Koa. As such, one potential solution is to use [`koa-webpack`][koa-webpack],
which wires up the dev middleware properly for Koa, and also implements this
module. If you'd like to use both modules without `koa-webpack`, you may examine
that module's code for implementation details.

## Browser Support

Because this module leverages _native_ `WebSockets`, the browser support for this
module is limited to only those browsers which support native `WebSocket`. That
typically means the last two major versions of a particular browser.

_Note: We won't be accepting requests for changes to this facet of the module._

## API

### client(compiler, [options])

Returns an `Object` containing:

- `close()` *(Function)* - Closes the WebSocketServer started by the module.
- `wss` *(WebSocketServer)* - A WebSocketServer instance.

#### options

Type: `Object`

##### allEntries

Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `false`

If true and `autoConfigure` is true, will automatically configures each `entry`
key for the webpack compiler. Typically used when working with or manipulating
different chunks in the same compiler configuration.

##### autoConfigure

Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `true`

If true, automatically configures the `entry` for the webpack compiler, and adds
the `HotModuleReplacementPlugin` to the compiler.

##### host

Type: `String|Object`  
Default: `'localhost'`

Sets the host that the `WebSocket` server will listen on. If this doesn't match
the host of the server the module is used with, the module may not function
properly. If the `server` option is defined, this option is ignored.

If using the module in a specialized environment, you may choose to specify an
`object` to define `client` and `server` host separately. The `object` value
should match `{ client: <String>, server: <String> }`. Be aware that the `client`
host will be used _in the browser_ by `WebSockets`. You should not use this
option in this way unless _you know what you're doing._ Using a mismatched
`client` and `server` host will be **unsupported by the project** as the behavior
in the browser can be unpredictable and is specific to a particular environment.

##### hot

Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `true`

If true, instructs the client script to attempt hot patching of modules.

##### https

Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `false`

If true, instructs the client script to use `wss://` as the `WebSocket` protocol.
If you're using a server setup with `HTTPS`, you must set this to `true` or the
sockets cannot communicate and this module won't function properly.

##### logLevel

Type: `String`  
Default: `'info'`

Sets the minimum level of logs that will be displayed in the console. Please see
[webpack-log/#levels][levels] for valid values.

##### logTime

Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `false`

If true, instructs the internal logger to prepend log output with a timestamp.

##### port

Type: `Number`  
Default: `8081`

The port the `WebSocket` server should listen on. It's recommended that a
[`server`](#server) instance is passed to assure there aren't any port conflicts.

##### reload

Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `true`

If true, instructs the browser to physically refresh the entire page if / when
webpack indicates that a hot patch cannot be applied and a full refresh is needed.  

This option also instructs the browser whether or not to refresh the entire page
when `hot: false` is used.

_Note: If both `hot` and `reload` are false, and these are permanent settings,
it makes this module fairly useless._

##### server

Type: `Object`  
Default: `null`

If a server instance (eg. Express or Koa) is provided, the `WebSocket` server
will attempt to attach to the server instance instead of using a separate port.

##### stats

Type: `Object`  
Default: `{ context: process.cwd() }`

An object specifying the webpack [stats][stats] configuration. This does not
typically need to be modified.

## Webpack Build Targets

By default, `webpack-hot-client` is meant to, and expects to function on the
[`'web'` build target](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/target). However,
you can manipulate this by setting the `WHC_TARGET` environment variable. eg.

```console
$ export WHC_TARGET=electon-renderer; webpack-serve ...
```

Or by setting `process.env.WHC_TARGET` before executing the API.

_Note: Changing this value is allowed but is **unsupported**._

## Communicating with Client WebSockets

In some rare situations, you may have the need to communicate with the attached
`WebSockets` in the browser. To accomplish this, open a new `WebSocket` to the
server, and send a `broadcast` message. eg.

```js
const stringify = require('json-stringify-safe');
const { WebSocket } = require('ws');

const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8081'); // this should match the server settings
const data = {
  type: 'broadcast',
  data: { // the message you want to broadcast
    type: '<something fun>', // the message type you want to broadcast
    data: { ... } // the message data you want to broadcast
  }
};

socket.send(stringify(data));
```

_Note: The `data` property of the message should contain the enveloped message
you wish to broadcast to all other client `WebSockets`._
